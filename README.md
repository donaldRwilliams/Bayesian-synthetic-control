This repo is an attempt to use the code of [Lee, Kim, and Gupta (2020)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0022243720936230) to learn Bayesian synthetic control. I attempt to use their model to duplicate the results from Scott Cunningham's [Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com/synthetic-control.html). You can find the code for Lee, Kim, and Gupta's (2020) in their supplementary materials.

At this point I have not changed the code of either Cunningham or Lee, Kim, and Gupta.

This is a work in progress, and contributions are welcome.
